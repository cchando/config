;; ; determines whether a File with name fname occurs in the directory tree rooted at d
;; ; NOTE -- this function looks very confusing, but it works and does not contain redundancy.
;; ; Become familiar with reading folds that use explicit recursion (like this one),
;; ; since they solve problems elegantly.
;; ; Here, the 'or' in the fold is NOT 'or'ing across various hierarchical levels; it's only 'or'ing across
;; ; the list of dirs in a particular level. Remember, a fold is iterative, not recursive!
;; ; The if-clause is where the propagation happens. If the File is here, the #true value gets
;; ; returned as the value of the (exists? (Dir f)) in the previous fold_ expression.
;; ; This #true is not truly being "propagated" outward, though; it's only going up ONE level to the previous
;; ; fold_ expression. However, a #true resulting from a fold_ evaluation several levels below d DOES
;; ; propagate upward to d, since that's where a recursive call happens. The propagation happens
;; ; because of the recursive call, not because there's a fold being used. Again, fold_ is ITERATIVE.
;; ; In this case, fold_ just happens to combine the accumulator with a recursive call.
;; ; So it's just 'or'ing across (Dir-dirs root), and probing downward in each x in this list until it finds
;; ; a result, either by hitting a 'found', or by reaching a leaf directory. This result comes back
;; ; up to the top level, where it's 'or'ed with the results of the other directories in (Dir-dirs root)
;; ;   -- 'or'ing iteratively across the results of processing each of the dirs in (Dir-dirs root).
;; ;      This is short-circuited when one of these dirs returns #true.
;; ;   -- when processing each of these dirs in (Dir-dirs d), we only search deeper as needed.
;; ;      As with any recursion, the result propages upward to each Dir in (Dir-dirs root).
;; ;      If the File is here, we say so and stop searching any deeper.
;; ; Of course, this is a horrible way of doing it, compared to using ormap below.
;; ; But the point here is to become proficient in quickly reading what's going on in an arbitrary fold.
